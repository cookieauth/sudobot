## How to report a bug 

If you've found a bug, you can create an issue on the GitHub repo. Include as much information as possible, so that we can help you as quick as possible.
Also it's best to make sure that a similar issue was not already reported.
Please note that security issues should be reported via email only and should not be discussed in public, because that might cause more issues rather that resolving it. 

## How to submit changes

Get started by forking this repository, then cloning it locally, and finally committing your work and creating a PR.
If we feel that your changes can be improved, we'll discuss about it with you.
